desc:software license	This software is provided under the terms of the Satoshi Fairware License (below). Your use of the software constitutes your acceptance of the license. Under this license, you agree to pay a fair price to the developers of this open-source software in exchange for GPL-like rights.
desc:software license:ask	The suggested fair amount to pay the developers, in accordance with the license, is:
desc:software license:key	c>@ developers across @ users
desc:software license:key1	c>@ developer across @ users
desc:software license:how	How to pay the developers:
desc:software license:explain:1	As more users pay, your investment can be proportionally refunded.
desc:software license:explain:2	When you update to a newer version, you may be asked to pay again to cover the development cost of the new features.
desc:software license:invest:1	Investment is Fairware's signature option. You get rebated every time your fair share decreases!
desc:software license:grant:1	By making a grant, your contribution will reduce the fair share of other users by paying down developer costs.
desc:software license:donate:1	Donating is the most direct way to pay the developers, but it will not reduce anyone else's fair share.
