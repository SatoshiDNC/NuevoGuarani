/*

The purpose of this class is to organize the construction and maintenance of
WebGL buffer data. At the lowest level, WebGL needs vertex, color, and texture
coordinates to be stored in buffers with a defined modulus and other
parameters. This class facilitates creation, update, and use of those buffers.
